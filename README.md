# SRM Unigram — Backend

This is the backend repository for **SRM Unigram**, a full-stack social media platform built exclusively for SRM students & faculty, 
where students & faculty can share photos, professional posts, events, certifications, and news — all in one place.

The backend handles:
- Authentication
- Post management
- Secure student verification
- All server-side logic

---

## Core Responsibilities
- Strict SRM email–based authentication (signup, login)
- OTP verification system (Mailjet)
- JWT-based session handling
- Secure password hashing with **bcrypt**
- Handling three categories of posts:
  - Photo posts (Instagram-style)
  - Professional posts (LinkedIn-style)
  - Text/news posts (Twitter-style)
- Feed system combining all SRM students (no department-wise feeds)
- Protected routes with auth middleware
- MySQL database integration

---
